# Diabetes Prediction with Decision Tree 🧠🌿

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict diabetes outcomes based on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**. It demonstrates basic machine learning workflow from data loading, preprocessing, model training to evaluation and visualization.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age  
> 🎯 Target Variable: `Outcome` (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz
